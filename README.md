This project focuses primarily on the detection of fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The project involves the comparison of different machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistic Regression. Deep learning algorithms, which are known to be more accurate than machine learning algorithms, will also be utilized in this project. The project will compare various deep learning algorithms by adjusting the number of hidden layers . The study will use the European card benchmark dataset, and the results will be compared to determine the most accurate method for identifying credit card fraud in real-world scenarios.
